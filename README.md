Leap Year Checker
Overview

The Leap Year Checker is a simple Python program that determines whether a given year is a leap year based on specific rules. It helps users verify leap years quickly and easily.

Code Logic

    Divisible by 4: The year must be divisible by 4.
    Divisible by 100 and 400:
        If the year is divisible by 100, check if it’s also divisible by 400.
        If it is divisible by 400, it’s a leap year; otherwise, it’s not.
    If the year doesn’t satisfy the above conditions, it’s not a leap year.
